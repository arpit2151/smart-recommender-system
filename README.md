# 🎬 Smart Recommender System

A **Full Stack Movie Recommendation System** built using **FastAPI (Python)** for the backend and **React + Vite** for the frontend.  
It demonstrates the principles of **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** and **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** using dummy datasets — making it a great educational and showcase project for machine learning–based recommendation systems.
